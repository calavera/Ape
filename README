== Atom Protocol Exerciser (APE)

APE is a sanity-checker for implementations of the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP). It is written in Ruby,
and provides a Mongrel-based HTML interface describing its interactions with the APP implementation under test.

For more information about the history and impetus for the creation of APE, see Tim Bray's account here[http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape].

== Quick Start

=== Install APE via RubyGems:

 $ gem install ape
 
Now, you should have the ape_server command available in your $PATH. Start the server with:

 $ ape_server
 
This will start the server in the foreground. You can access APE in your browser at http://localhost:4000

=== Execute APE from the command line:

If you've downloaded APE's source code you can execute it from the command line with ruby rake. From the root directory you can execute one of these three tasks:

 $ rake ape:go:html['service document uri', 'username', 'password']
 $ rake ape:go:text['service document uri', 'username', 'password']
 $ rake ape:go:atom['service document uri', 'username', 'password']

The username and password parameters are not mandatory, and the format response depends on the executed task.
